# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS

The task is to build an AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or SpaCy, capable of answering user queries. Here's a concise breakdown of the content:
**NLP** is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate text.
Libraries like NLTK and SpaCy are popular for performing tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
Building the Chatbot:
*Input*: The chatbot should receive queries or inputs from the user in natural language.
*Processing*: Using NLP techniques, the chatbot processes the input to understand the meaning and intent.
*NLTK*: Provides various tools for tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.
*SpaCy*: Offers faster NLP capabilities with pre-trained models for tasks like dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and more.
*Response Generation**: Based on the input, the chatbot generates a relevant response. This can be through predefined rules, machine learning models, or information retrieval methods.
*Key NLP Tasks for the Chatbot*:Text Preprocessing: Clean the input text (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.) and break it into meaningful chunks like sentences or words.
*Intent Recognition*: Identifying the userâ€™s intent, such as asking for information or performing a task.
*Entity Recognition*: Identifying key entities like dates, locations, or product names from the user's input.
*Response Generation*: Generating appropriate responses based on the recognized intent and entities.
**Libraries Used**:*NLTK*: Provides various modules for text processing (tokenization, stemming, etc.), useful for building a basic chatbot.
In conclusion, the task involves using NLP techniques to create a chatbot that can efficiently answer user queries, leveraging powerful libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for text processing and understanding
